        "justification": "Reduced capital expenditure is a fundamental advantage of cloud computing, particularly appealing for startups. By migrating to the cloud, companies avoid the high upfront costs associated with purchasing and maintaining physical infrastructure, shifting from capital expenditure (CapEx) to operational expenditure (OpEx). This model allows for scaling resources up or down based on demand, thus optimizing costs. The transition from CapEx to OpEx not only enhances financial flexibility but also allows startups to allocate resources more strategically while scaling operations efficiently."
