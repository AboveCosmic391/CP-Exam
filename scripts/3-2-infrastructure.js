A Region is a geographical area that contains multiple, isolated Availability Zones to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. AWS edge locations are separate, globally distributed locations specifically used for caching and delivering content closer to end users, providing low latency and high performance.\n\n- A is incorrect because edge locations are not part of the hierarchy within a Region and do not contain Availability Zones.\n- B is incorrect because Availability Zones do not contain Regions, and edge locations are not nested within Availability Zones.\n- C is incorrect because edge locations are not nested within Availability Zones but are separate entities used for content delivery."
