These keys provide the necessary credentials for making API calls to AWS services, such as creating and interacting with S3 buckets. AWS Management Console credentials are used for logging into the console, AWS Support Center credentials are for accessing support services, and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) codes are used to enhance security during the login process but are not used for API authentication.

While the AWS Management Console provides a graphical interface, the CLI offers a way to execute commands programmatically, making it ideal for automation. The CLI is not the only tool that allows access to all AWS services, as the APIs and SDKs also provide this functionality.

CloudFormation allows them to define the infrastructure and configuration in a template file, which can then be used to provision and manage resources in a consistent and automated manner. This approach reduces the likelihood of configuration mistakes and ensures that the test environment is set up exactly as specified every time. The AWS Management Console is prone to manual errors, AWS SDKs require more detailed programming effort, and AWS Trusted Advisor provides recommendations but does not automate the creation of resources.
