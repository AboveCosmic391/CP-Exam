        "justification": "AWS Backup is a fully managed backup service that centralizes and automates backups across various AWS services, including Amazon RDS, Amazon EC2, and Amazon EFS. It provides a simple, centralized console for managing backup policies, scheduling backups, and restoring data across different AWS resources. By choosing AWS Backup, GlobalTech can efficiently manage backups for all their AWS resources while ensuring compliance with data retention policies.\n\nIncorrect Answer A: AWS Storage Gateway is primarily used for integrating on-premises IT environments with AWS storage services, such as Amazon S3 and Amazon Glacier, and does not provide centralized backup management capabilities like AWS Backup.\n\nIncorrect Answer B: While Amazon S3 can be used for storing backups, it does not offer the centralized backup management features provided by AWS Backup. Managing backups across multiple AWS services using Amazon S3 would require custom scripts or manual processes.\n\nIncorrect Answer D: Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager is a service that automates the lifecycle management of Amazon EBS snapshots, but it does not provide centralized backup management capabilities for other AWS services like AWS Backup does."
