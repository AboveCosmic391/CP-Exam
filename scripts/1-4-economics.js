She is considering the differences between fixed costs and variable costs in this migration. Which of the following best defines fixed costs compared with variable costs in the context of cloud migration?",
        "options": {
            "A": "Fixed costs are expenses that remain constant regardless of the level of cloud usage, while variable costs fluctuate based on usage.",
            "B": "Fixed costs are incurred only during the initial setup of cloud services, while variable costs are ongoing expenses related to cloud usage.",
            "C": "Fixed costs represent the cost of cloud services that can be negotiated with the cloud provider, while variable costs are determined by the level of demand for cloud resources.",
            "D": "Fixed costs include the price of cloud services that are prepaid for a fixed period, while variable costs are incurred based on the amount of data transferred between on-premises and cloud environments."
