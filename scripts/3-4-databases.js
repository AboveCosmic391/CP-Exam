        "justification": "When deciding between Amazon EC2 hosted databases and AWS managed databases, the software development team should consider factors such as: \n- The level of control and customization required: EC2 hosted databases offer more control and flexibility, allowing the team to customize the database environment to their specific requirements. Managed databases, on the other hand, abstract away much of the infrastructure management, providing a more simplified and managed experience.\n- Scalability and performance requirements: Managed databases typically offer built-in scalability features, such as automatic scaling and performance optimization, making them suitable for applications with unpredictable or rapidly changing workloads. EC2 hosted databases may require more manual intervention to scale and optimize performance, depending on the workload demands."
