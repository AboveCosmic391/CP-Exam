You have been asked to implement a solution that allows these users to authenticate using their existing credentials and gain access to AWS resources as federated users. Which AWS tool should you use to achieve this, and what is the primary purpose of federated users?",
        "options": {
            "A": "AWS CloudTrail; to monitor API activity in the AWS environment",
            "B": "AWS Directory Service; to manage AWS resources using LDAP directories",
            "C": "AWS Single Sign-On (SSO); to federate users and allow them to use existing corporate credentials to access AWS resources",
            "D": "AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM); to create and manage individual user accounts within AWS"
        },
        "correctAnswer": "C",
        "domain": "Security and Compliance",
        "subDomain": "2.3 Identify AWS Access Management Capabilities",
        "justification": "Federated users are individuals who authenticate using existing corporate credentials, such as those stored in an Active Directory or other identity provider, rather than having individual IAM accounts in AWS. AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) is the tool designed to provide this functionality, enabling users to sign in with their existing credentials and gain access to AWS resources without the need for separate AWS accounts. AWS CloudTrail is used for monitoring API activity, AWS Directory Service is used to integrate with LDAP directories, and AWS IAM is for creating and managing individual AWS user accounts, but it does not provide the federation capabilities needed in this scenario."
